4.9: Addition and Subtraction of Radicals 
4.9.1) MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE NON-RADICALS BY NON-RADICALS AND RADICALS BY RADICALS
 
When an expression or equation contains both radicals and non-radicals, multiply radicals by radicals (if they have the same index) and multiply non-radicals by non-radicals. For example, given the expression \(2\sqrt {10}  \times 4\sqrt 7 \), we can multiply the 2 by the 4 and the \(\sqrt {10} \) by the \(\sqrt 7 \) to yield \(8\sqrt {70} \). Similarly, given the expression \(\frac{{10\sqrt {100} }}{{5\sqrt {10} }}\), we can divide the 10 by the 5 and the \(\sqrt {100} \) by \(\sqrt {10} \) to yield \(2\sqrt {10} \).
 
Must Know : When multiplying or dividing expressions that combine non-radicals and radicals, multiply and divide non-radicals by non-radicals, and radicals by radicals (if they have the same index). That is, \(\left( {a\sqrt[n]{b}} \right)\left( {c\sqrt[n]{d}} \right) = ac\sqrt[n]{{bd}}\) and \(\frac{{a\sqrt[n]{b}}}{{c\sqrt[n]{d}}} = \frac{a}{c}\sqrt[n]{{\frac{b}{d}}}\) .
 
Consider the following examples.
 
Example 8:
 
\(2\sqrt {10}  \times 5\sqrt 2 \) is equal to which of the following?

\[{\rm{(A) 10}}\sqrt 2 {\rm{      }}(B){\rm{ 10}}\sqrt 5 {\rm{      (}}C){\rm{ 20}}\sqrt 2 {\rm{        }}(D){\rm{ 20}}\sqrt 5 {\rm{      }}(E){\rm{ 40}}\sqrt 5 \]

Solution:

\( \Rightarrow 2\sqrt {10}  \times 5\sqrt 2  = 10\sqrt {20}  = 10 \times \sqrt 4  \times \sqrt 5  = 10 \times 2 \times \sqrt 5  = 20\sqrt 5 \)

Answer: D

Example 9:
 
If x = \(\frac{{28\sqrt {200} }}{{14}}\) and y = \(\frac{{36\sqrt {80} }}{{\sqrt {10} }}\) , then \(\frac{x}{y}\) is equal to which of the following:
\[{\ rm{(A) }}\frac{5}{{18}}{\rm{      }}(B){\rm{ }}\frac{7}{{15}}{\rm{      (}}C){\rm{ 40        }}(D){\rm{ 45       }}(E){\rm{ }}\frac{{9\sqrt {14} }}{5}\]
 
Solution:
 
Let’s begin by simplifying x and y. We can divide non-radicals by non-radicals and radicals by radicals.
 
\( \Rightarrow x = \frac{{28\sqrt {200} }}{{14}} = 2\sqrt {200} \)
\( \Rightarrow \)\(y = \frac{{36\sqrt {80} }}{{\sqrt {10} }} = 36\sqrt 8 \)
\( \Rightarrow \)\(\frac{x}{y} = \frac{{2\sqrt {200} }}{{36\sqrt 8 }} = \frac{1}{{18}}\sqrt {25}  = \frac{5}{{18}}\) 
 
Answer: A
 
 
4.10: Addition and Subtraction of Radicals 
 
Be careful when adding and subtracting radicals such as square roots. Since the order of operations instructs us to perform all of the operations under a radical prior to taking the root, \(\sqrt {a + b}  \ne \sqrt a  + \sqrt b \), and \(\sqrt {a - b}  \ne \sqrt a  - \sqrt b \). For example, \(\sqrt {25 + 16}  \ne \sqrt {25}  + \sqrt {16} \), and similarly, \(\sqrt {25 - 16}  \ne \sqrt {25}  - \sqrt {16} \). Instead,\(\sqrt {25 + 16}  = \sqrt {41}  \approx 6.403\), and \(\sqrt {25}  + \sqrt {16}  = 5 + 4 = 9\). Similarly, \(\sqrt {25 - 16}  = \sqrt 9  = 3\), and \(\sqrt {25}  - \sqrt {16}  = 5 - 4 = 1\).
 
Must Know: The order of operations stipulates that we perform any addition or subtraction under a radical prior to taking the root. Thus, \(\sqrt {a + b}  \ne \sqrt a  + \sqrt b \), and \(\sqrt {a - b}  \ne \sqrt a  - \sqrt b \). Similarly, \(\sqrt a  + \sqrt b  \ne \sqrt {a + b} \), and \(\sqrt a  - \sqrt b  \ne \sqrt {a - b} \).
 
Consider the following examples.
 
Example 10:
 
If x = \(\sqrt {16 + 9} \) , what is the value of x?
 
\[{\rm{(A) }}4{\rm{       }}(B){\rm{ 5      (}}C){\rm{ 6        }}(D){\rm{ 7       }}(E){\rm{ 8}}\]
 
Solution:
 
The operations under the radical must be resolved before taking the square root. Thus, \(x = \sqrt {16 + 9}  = \sqrt {25}  = 5\) . Note: The solution is not \(\sqrt {16}  + \sqrt 9  = 4 + 3 = 7\) .
 
Answer: B
 
 
Example 11:
 
If \[y = \sqrt {\frac{{{x^2}}}{{25}} + \frac{{{x^2}}}{{100}}} \], which of the following could be the value of y?
 
\[{\rm{(A) }}\frac{{3\left| x \right|}}{{10}}{\rm{       }}(B){\rm{ }}\frac{{5\left| x \right|}}{{10}}{\rm{      (}}C){\rm{ }}\frac{{\left| x \right|\sqrt 5 }}{{10}}{\rm{        }}(D){\rm{ }}\frac{{\sqrt 5 }}{{10}}{\rm{       }}(E){\rm{ }}\frac{{\sqrt {5x} }}{{10}}\]
 
Solution:
While it may be tempting to take the square root of \[\frac{{{x^2}}}{{25}}\] and \(\frac{{{x^2}}}{{100}}\) separately and then add the results, we must first perform the addition under the radical and then take the square root. First find a common denominator under the radical:
 
\[ \Rightarrow \sqrt {\frac{{{x^2}}}{{25}} + \frac{{{x^2}}}{{100}}}  = \sqrt {\frac{{4{x^2}}}{{100}} + \frac{{{x^2}}}{{100}}}  = \sqrt {\frac{{5{x^2}}}{{100}}} \]
 
Now, take the square root of the numerator and denominator:
 
\( \Rightarrow \sqrt {\frac{{5{x^2}}}{{100}}}  = \frac{{\sqrt 5  \times \sqrt {{x^2}} }}{{\sqrt {100} }} = \frac{{\left| x \right|\sqrt 5 }}{{10}}\)
 
Answer: C
 
4.10.1) ADD AND SUBTRACT ONLY LIKE RADICALS
 
Two or more radicals are like radicals if they have both the same root index (square root, cube root, fourth root, etc.) and the same radicand (the expression under the radical). For example, \(5\sqrt 4 \)and \(4\sqrt 4 \) are like radicals since they are both square roots of the radicand 4. Thus, we can add these radicals to yield \(9\sqrt 4 \). Notice that if instead we had two radicals such as \(9\sqrt 4 \) and\(4\sqrt 9 \), we could not add them since root 4 and root 9 are not like radicals.
 
Must Know: Add or subtract like radicals only. Two or more radicals are like radicals if they have both the same root index and the same radicand (expression under the radical).
 
Consider the following example.
 
Example 12:
 
If x = \[10\sqrt {18}  + {\rm{ }}4\sqrt {21}  + {\rm{ }}5\sqrt {72} \], then x is equal to which of the following?
 
\[{\rm{(A) }}60\sqrt 3  + 4\sqrt {21} {\rm{       }}(B){\rm{ }}60\sqrt 3  + 4\sqrt {20} {\rm{      (}}C){\rm{ }}2\sqrt 3  + 4\sqrt {21} {\rm{        }}(D){\rm{ }}60\sqrt 5  + 4\sqrt {21} {\rm{       }}(E){\rm{ }}60\sqrt 2  + 4\sqrt {21} \]
 
Solution:
\[\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow 10\sqrt {18}  + 4\sqrt {21}  + 5\sqrt {72} \\ \Rightarrow 10 \times \sqrt 9  \times \sqrt 2  + 4\sqrt {21}  + 5\sqrt {36}  \times \sqrt 2 \\ \Rightarrow 10 \times 3 \times \sqrt 2  + 4\sqrt {21}  + 5 \times 6 \times \sqrt 2 \\ \Rightarrow 30\sqrt 2  + 4\sqrt {21}  + 30\sqrt 2 \\ \Rightarrow 60\sqrt 2  + 4\sqrt {21} \end{array}\]
 
This cannot be simplified any further since root 2 and root 21 are not like radicals. Notice we didn’t simplify\(\sqrt {21} \) since 21 is not a perfect square and since it does not contain a perfect square factor > 1.
 
Answer: E
 
4.11: Radicals in the Denominator of a Fraction 
 
On the GMAT, radicals must be removed from the denominator in order for the expression to be considered simplified. There are two common cases in which we will have to simplify a fraction by removing a radical from the denominator.
 
4.11.1) THERE IS A SINGLE-TERM RADICAL IN THE DENOMINATOR.
 
The expression \(\frac{3}{{\sqrt 5 }}\)is not simplified since there is a radical in the denominator. To remove the radical, we’ll use a process called rationalizing the denominator. To rationalize a single-term radical in the denominator of a fraction, multiply the fraction by the radical over itself. The expression \(\frac{3}{{\sqrt 5 }}\)can be rationalized as \(\frac{3}{{\sqrt 5 }} \times \frac{{\sqrt 5 }}{{\sqrt 5 }} = \frac{{3\sqrt 5 }}{5}\).
Notice that after the rationalization, the radical is no longer in the denominator. Since \(\frac{{\sqrt 5 }}{{\sqrt 5 }} = 1\), rationalizing a fraction does not alter the value of the fraction; rather, the process only changes its appearance. In general, if a is not a perfect square, \(\frac{x}{{\sqrt a }}\) is not simplified because it has a radical in its denominator. After rationalizing, we have a well-simplified expression: \(\frac{x}{{\sqrt a }} \times \left( {\frac{{\sqrt a }}{{\sqrt a }}} \right) = \frac{{x\sqrt a }}{a}\).
 
Must Know: If a is not a perfect square, to rationalize a one-term radical,\(\sqrt a \), in the denominator of a fraction, multiply that fraction by \(\frac{{\sqrt a }}{{\sqrt a }}\).
 
Consider the following example.
 
Example 13:
 
If \(p = \frac{{3 + \sqrt 5 }}{{\sqrt 5 }}\), p is equal to which of the following?
 
\[{\rm{(A) }}\frac{{\sqrt 5 }}{5}{\rm{     }}(B){\rm{ }}\frac{{3\sqrt 5 }}{5}{\rm{     (}}C){\rm{ }}\frac{{3\sqrt 5 }}{5} + 1{\rm{        }}(D){\rm{ }}3\sqrt 5 {\rm{       }}(E){\rm{ }}3\sqrt 5  + 1\]
 
Solution:
 
Rationalize the denominator:
 
\( \Rightarrow \frac{{3 + \sqrt 5 }}{{\sqrt 5 }} \times \frac{{\sqrt 5 }}{{\sqrt 5 }} = \frac{{3\sqrt 5  + 5}}{5} = \frac{{3\sqrt 5 }}{5} + \frac{5}{5} = \frac{{3\sqrt 5 }}{5} + 1\)
